Automation

1.I used Selenium + Java because I have access to the IDEA on this language.
2.In my script I found element by className and validated new page by Title. 
3. It can be issues with element locators, browsers.
4.1. Realize Page object model (store features,steps,element locators for each page separately).
4.2. Separate data from the steps (data driven) by creating resource directory and storing configurable data (browser, url, login, password),
storing element locators for each page. You can store data also and in excel files.
